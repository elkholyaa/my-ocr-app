**Session Summary (2025-03-07):**

- **2025-03-07 12:05** – **Initial Context & Shift in Tech Stack**  
  - We began with a discussion about a Next.js OCR app project using pdf.js and Tailwind CSS.
  - You decided to switch the project to a Python-based solution for better extraction quality and flexibility.

- **2025-03-07 12:15** – **Project Plan Revision**  
  - An updated project plan was provided for the Python OCR app.
  - The plan outlines using FastAPI for the web framework, pdfplumber for PDF text extraction, and spaCy for NLP to extract key details from Bills of Lading.
  - The project file structure was defined as:
    ```
    my-ocr-app-python/
    ├── main.py
    ├── parse_bol_spacy.py
    ├── templates/
    │   └── index.html
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── README.md
    ```

- **2025-03-07 12:25** – **Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions**  
  - We provided step-by-step instructions to set up the Python project from scratch:
    - Creating the project folder and files.
    - Writing `main.py` to create the FastAPI app with endpoints for serving an HTML form and processing uploaded PDFs.
    - Creating `templates/index.html` for the upload form.
    - Writing `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies.
    - Drafting a `README.md` for documentation.
  
- **2025-03-07 12:40** – **Code Delivery for main.py and parse_bol_spacy.py**  
  - Full file contents for `main.py` were provided, which:
    - Sets up FastAPI endpoints.
    - Uses pdfplumber to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
    - Calls the parsing function from `parse_bol_spacy.py`.
  - Full file contents for `parse_bol_spacy.py` were delivered. This module:
    - Normalizes the extracted text.
    - Uses regex (combined with spaCy for entity extraction) to capture:
      - `BILL_OF_LADING_No` (by matching a "MEDUP" code).
      - `SHIPPER` (by extracting text after the label "SHIPPER:" without hard-coding a specific company name).
      - `CONSIGNEE` (by capturing the block after "CONSIGNEE:" up to the next marker).
      - Total weight, total items, container count, and container details.
    - Returns the JSON structure in the desired format.

- **2025-03-07 12:55** – **Discussion on Hard-Coding vs. Structural Markers**  
  - We discussed the limitations of hard-coding specific strings like `"INTERCROMA SA"` and how to instead rely on general structural markers (e.g., `"SHIPPER:"`, `"CONSIGNEE:"`) to make the parser more flexible.
  - Alternatives like using machine learning (e.g., LayoutLM) were mentioned, but we then focused on improving our spaCy‑enhanced parser.

- **2025-03-07 13:05** – **Integration of spaCy**  
  - A decision was made to integrate spaCy to improve extraction quality.
  - A new module (`parse_bol_spacy.py`) was developed that uses spaCy to process text blocks and extract organization entities, avoiding hard-coded company names.
  
- **2025-03-07 13:20** – **Full File Contents Delivered**  
  - Complete file contents for `main.py`, `parse_bol_spacy.py`, `templates/index.html`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` were provided.
  - Detailed instructions on how to install dependencies (including `python-multipart`) and run the FastAPI app were given.
  
- **2025-03-07 13:30** – **Troubleshooting and Final Adjustments**  
  - An error with the spaCy model not being found was resolved by instructing to run:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
  - We discussed debugging strategies for ensuring the regex and spaCy integration work well with the specific PDF sample.
  - Emphasis was placed on the fragility of regex with PDF text extraction and the potential for future improvements (e.g., using layout-based models).
